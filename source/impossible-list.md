# Impossible List

---
This list isn't meant to be a bucket list, it's meant to be a growth list. All of the items on here are something I or someone else has told me is impossible. Making it public is to hold me accountable and to always be working to make this list happen. It's going to start small, but as times goes on, it will grow and more items will be crossed out.

## The List

* Marry my best friend
* Start a family
* Succesfully exit a business I was a founder of
  * bonus points if it's 100% bootstrapped
* Use my home to generate all energy my family and I need, with storage for excess.
* Spend multiple nights in the mountains backpacking
