I'm a self-taught full-stack software engineer currently living and working in Des Moines, at [Denim Labs](https://denimlabs.com). Where we build software to automate digital marketing for large organizations. Since 2016, I've been fortunate enough to be involved in some early stage start-ups, which focused on automated chat. When I'm not working, I spend my time reading, at the gym, and  doing home renovation projects.
