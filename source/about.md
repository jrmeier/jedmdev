I'm a self-taught full-stack software engineer currently living and working in Des Moines, at [Denim Labs](https://denimlabs.com). Where we build software to automate digital marketing for large organizations. Since 2016, I've been fortunate enough to be involved in some early stage start-ups, which focused on automated chat. When I'm not working, I spend my time reading, at the gym, and  doing home renovation projects with my brother-in-law.

I headed up our main product, which was a cognitive framework, that allowed us to easily design conversations in ways that didn't suck. Our solution was a scalable architecture that allowed non-technical people to build a conversational interface that could extract information, anticipate responses, and provide responses not explicitly programmed from the end user. This allowed us to build a profile which made it possible to continue conversations and always have responses ready.
