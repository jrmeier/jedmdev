I'm a self-taught full-stack software engineer currently living and working in Des Moines, working at [Denim Labs](https://denimlabs.com), building software to automate digital marketing for companies that are't used to doing it. Since 2016, I've been fortunate enough to be involved of some early stage start-ups, which focused on automated chat. When I'm not doing tech things, I spend my time reading, at the gym, and  doing home renovation projects with my brother-in-law.

# Experience

## Full-Stack Sofware Engineer / May 2018 - Present
### [Denim Labs](https://denimlabs.com)  
*Local Marketing at Scale*

I write software to help large firms run their digital marketing platforms. Our front-end is built in [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and our brand-new backend serverless architecture, with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) acting as our data access layer, running on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and some Python.

## Backend Software Engineer / October 2017 - May 2018
### [Structurely](https://structurely.com) Ames, IA
*Helping real estate agents intelligently qualify and manage leads with our AI assistant, Aisa, and our web app, Homechat. With our many integrations, you can spend more time face-to-face and less time face-to-screen with your leads.*

I wrote software helping our AI assistants talk to the many different data providers, chat platforms, and our web app. I used lots of Python in this role.

## Head of Product
### Sodima Solutions / September 2016 - September 2017

I headed up our main product, which was a cognitive framework, that allowed us to easily design conversations in ways that didn't suck. Our solution was a scalable architecture that allowed non-technical people to build a solution that could extract information from the end user, building a profile which made it possible to continue conversations and be open for questions that didn't have explicitly programmed answers. This was also a very heavy Python role.
