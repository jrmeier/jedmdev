# Impossible List 

*Note, this list is directly inspired by my good friend [Brendon Geils](https://brendongriels.com) and his list, which took inspiration from others. For more about impossible lists, checkout [Impossible HQ](https://impossiblehq.com/create-impossible-list/)*

This list isn't meant to be a bucket list, it's meant to be a growth list. All of the items on here are something I or someone else has told me is impossible. Making it public is to hold me accountable and to always be working to make this list happen. It's going to start small, but as times goes on, it will grow and more items will be crossed out.
